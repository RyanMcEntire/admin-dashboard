Experiment learning Tailwind.

An admin dashboard to practice a more complex grid layout.
An attempt was made to learn Tailwind, and much was learned in the process about how to not do things.

I consider this a good learning experience, teaching myself the basics of how tailwind works. However, I didn't get a good feel for the benefits of using tailwind, the way that I used it in this project. I often found myself commiting to tedious practices only to realize far in why my approach was not ideal. This happened often with the grid structure. 

I found myself having difficulty building with the same level of finesse and confidence that I had developed while using vanilla CSS. 

I may come back to repeat the exercise later without Tailwind in between my other assignments. Maybe I will build it using SCSS to struggle with that instead!
